# 💍 The Ring - Skills Library for AI Agents

**Proven engineering practices, enforced through skills.**

Ring is a comprehensive skills library and workflow system for AI agents that transforms how AI assistants approach software development. Currently implemented as a **Claude Code plugin marketplace** with **4 active plugins**, **76 skills**, and **33 agents** (see `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` for current versions), the skills themselves are agent-agnostic and can be used with any AI agent system. Ring provides battle-tested patterns, mandatory workflows, and systematic approaches across the entire software delivery value chain.

## ✨ Why Ring?

Without Ring, AI assistants often:

- Skip tests and jump straight to implementation
- Make changes without understanding root causes
- Claim tasks are complete without verification
- Forget to check for existing solutions
- Repeat known mistakes

Ring solves this by:

- **Enforcing proven workflows** - Test-driven development, systematic debugging, proper planning
- **Providing 76 specialized skills** (23 core + 35 dev-team + 14 product planning + 4 technical writing)
- **33 specialized agents** - 2 planning/analysis + 24 developer/reviewer + 4 product research + 3 technical writing
- **Automating skill discovery** - Skills load automatically at session start
- **Preventing common failures** - Built-in anti-patterns and mandatory checklists

## 🧭 Project Identity

**Ring is Lerian-first, open-source-friendly.** Design decisions prioritize the Lerian engineering team's daily needs while keeping the architecture clean and reusable for external adoption. This means:

- **Lerian-specific skills stay active** — Internal integrations and domain-specific workflows remain in the marketplace because the team uses them
- **The architecture is universal** — Skills, agents, and the plugin system work with any codebase or team
- **Archival is usage-driven** — Skills are archived when they stop being used, not because they're "too specific"

### 📦 Archived Plugins

The following plugins have been archived and are not actively maintained. They remain available in `.archive/` for reference:

| Plugin         | Description                                             | Status                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pmm-team`     | Product Marketing (GTM, positioning, competitive intel) | Archived - functionality may be restored based on demand |
| `finance-team` | Financial planning and analysis                         | Archived - under evaluation                              |

_To restore an archived plugin, move its folder from `.archive/` to the root directory and register it in `marketplace.json`._

## 🖥️ Supported Platforms

Ring works across multiple AI development platforms:

| Platform        | Native manifest        | Symlink installer       | Status             |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Claude Code** | ✅ marketplace.json    | ✅ `--claude`           | Source of truth    |
| **Codex**       | ✅ `.codex-plugin/`    | ✅ `--codex` (built)    | Both paths work    |
| **OpenCode**    | ✅ `.opencode/`        | ✅ `--opencode` (built) | Both paths work    |
| **Cursor**      | ✅ `.cursor-plugin/`   | ❌ not in installer     | Native only        |
| **Factory AI**  | ❌                     | ✅ `--factory`          | Installer only     |

**Two install mechanisms:**

- **Native manifest** — the harness installs Ring directly from this repo via its own package manager (`opencode.json`, Cursor plugin marketplace, Codex plugin manifest). No local build step, no manual symlink work. Best for end users and CI.
- **Symlink installer** (`ring-install.sh`) — symlinks from your local harness config dir into a cloned Ring repo. For Codex/OpenCode, the installer builds a transformed tree at `.ring-build/` first (namespace + frontmatter rewrites). Best for local development with hot-reload against the source tree.

See the [`Native plugin install`](#native-plugin-install-per-harness) and [`Symlink installer`](#symlink-installer-local-dev) sub-sections below for usage.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Native plugin install (per harness)

Each Ring plugin ships native manifests for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and OpenCode. The harness installs the plugin directly from this repo via its own package manager — no transformation step, no local installer.

| Harness         | Mechanism                                | Per-plugin entry points |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Claude Code** | `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (root) | All 4 plugins enumerated in one marketplace file |
| **Codex**       | `<plugin>/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`     | [default](default/.codex-plugin/plugin.json) · [dev-team](dev-team/.codex-plugin/plugin.json) · [pm-team](pm-team/.codex-plugin/plugin.json) · [tw-team](tw-team/.codex-plugin/plugin.json) |
| **Cursor**      | `<plugin>/.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`    | [default](default/.cursor-plugin/plugin.json) · [dev-team](dev-team/.cursor-plugin/plugin.json) · [pm-team](pm-team/.cursor-plugin/plugin.json) · [tw-team](tw-team/.cursor-plugin/plugin.json) |
| **OpenCode**    | `<plugin>/.opencode/` (INSTALL + JS plugin) | [default](default/.opencode/INSTALL.md) · [dev-team](dev-team/.opencode/INSTALL.md) · [pm-team](pm-team/.opencode/INSTALL.md) · [tw-team](tw-team/.opencode/INSTALL.md) |

**`ring-default` is the foundation plugin** — install it alongside any other Ring plugin since it provides the `using-ring` bootstrap that orients agent behavior. Example for OpenCode:

```json
{
  "plugin": [
    "ring-default@git+https://github.com/lerianstudio/ring.git#main",
    "ring-dev-team@git+https://github.com/lerianstudio/ring.git#main"
  ]
}
```

Each harness's INSTALL.md (for OpenCode) or `plugin.json` (for Codex/Cursor) carries the exact install command for that platform.

### Symlink installer (local dev)

`ring-install.sh` symlinks your harness's local config dir into this cloned Ring repo. For Codex and OpenCode, it first builds a transformed tree at `.ring-build/` (namespace + frontmatter rewrites required by those tools).

**Supported targets:** Claude Code, Factory AI, OpenCode, Codex.
**Not supported by the installer:** Cursor (use the [native plugin install above](#native-plugin-install-per-harness)).

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/lerianstudio/ring.git ~/ring
cd ~/ring

# Interactive menu (lets you pick targets)
bash ring-install.sh

# Or target specific harnesses without the prompt:
bash ring-install.sh --claude               # Claude Code (per-file symlinks)
bash ring-install.sh --factory              # Factory AI (per-file symlinks)
bash ring-install.sh --opencode             # OpenCode (builds .ring-build/opencode/ first)
bash ring-install.sh --codex                # Codex    (builds .ring-build/codex/ first)
bash ring-install.sh --all                  # All four supported targets
```

#### Installer subcommands

```bash
bash ring-install.sh install --opencode --codex   # install symlinks for selected targets
bash ring-install.sh remove                        # remove all Ring symlinks
bash ring-install.sh build                         # rebuild .ring-build/{opencode,codex} only
bash ring-install.sh clean                         # remove .ring-build/ outputs
bash ring-install.sh doctor                        # verify install + build outputs
bash ring-install.sh all --all -y                  # clean + build + install for all targets, no prompt
```

**Flags:** `--yes` / `-y` (skip confirmation), `--dry-run` (preview without changes), `--force` (back up non-symlink collisions), `--verbose`.

### Claude Code Plugin Marketplace

For Claude Code users, you can also install from the marketplace:

- Open Claude Code
- Go to Settings → Plugins
- Search for "ring"
- Click Install

### Manual Installation (Claude Code only)

```bash
# Clone the marketplace repository
git clone https://github.com/lerianstudio/ring.git ~/ring

# Skills auto-load at session start via hooks
# No additional configuration needed for Claude Code
```

### Code Analysis Pipeline

The `ring:reviewing-code` pipeline uses [Mithril](https://github.com/LerianStudio/mithril), an external code analysis tool installed via `go install`. Mithril performs static analysis, AST extraction, call graph generation, and context compilation for AI-assisted code review.

Install via `go install github.com/lerianstudio/mithril@latest`. See the [Mithril repository](https://github.com/LerianStudio/mithril) for full installation details and release notes.

        [Pre-dev workflow: PRD, TRD, plan]
Claude: I'm using ring:test-driven-development to implement...
        [RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle for each component]
Claude: I'm using ring:reviewing-code to validate...
        [9 defaults + conditional specialist parallel dispatch]
```

### Fixing a Bug

```
User: "The app crashes when clicking submit"
Claude: Investigating the crash:
        Phase 1: [Gathering evidence]
        Phase 2: [Pattern analysis]
        Phase 3: [Hypothesis testing]
        Phase 4: [Implementing fix with test]
```

### Planning a Project

```
User: "Plan an e-commerce platform"
Claude: I'll use the pre-dev workflow to plan this systematically...
        Gate 1: PRD Creation [Business requirements]
        Gate 2: Feature Map [Domain groupings]
        Gate 3: TRD Creation [Architecture patterns]
        ... [Through all 8 gates]
```

### Code Review (Parallel, 9 Defaults + Conditional Specialists)

```
User: "Review my authentication implementation"
Claude: Dispatching all 9 default reviewers plus triggered conditional specialists in parallel...
        [Launches ring:code-reviewer, ring:logic-reviewer, ring:security-reviewer,
         ring:test-reviewer, ring:nil-reviewer,
         ring:dead-code-reviewer, ring:perf-reviewer, ring:tenancy-reviewer,
         ring:commons-reviewer simultaneously]
        Conditional specialists trigger only when the diff touches their stack:
        lib-observability, lib-systemplane, or lib-streaming.

        Code reviewer: PASS. Clean architecture, good tests.
        Business reviewer: FAIL. Missing password reset flow (HIGH severity).
        Security reviewer: FAIL. JWT secret hardcoded (CRITICAL severity).
        Test reviewer: PASS. Good coverage, assertions well-structured.
        Nil-safety reviewer: PASS. No unguarded nil dereferences found.
        Performance reviewer: PASS. No hotspots or goroutine leaks found.
        Multi-tenant reviewer: PASS. No multi-tenant code in scope.
        lib-commons reviewer: PASS. Correct shared-library usage, no reinvented wheels detected.

        Aggregating issues by severity:
        - CRITICAL: JWT secret hardcoded in auth.ts:42
        - HIGH: Password reset flow missing from requirements

        Review report complete. No files changed by reviewers.
        Fixes require a separate implementation step, then a new review run.
```

**Key benefits:**

- **All reviewers run simultaneously** (not sequential)
- **Comprehensive** - Get all feedback at once, easier to prioritize
- **Report-only boundary** - Reviewers report findings; remediation is a separate step
- **Specialized lanes** - Each reviewer owns a clear domain to avoid duplicate slop

## 🤝 Contributing

### Adding a New Skill

**For core Ring skills:**

1. **Create the skill directory**

   ```bash
   mkdir default/skills/your-skill-name
   ```

2. **Write SKILL.md with frontmatter**

   ```yaml
   ---
   name: ring:your-skill-name
   description: Single paragraph (≤500 chars target, 1,536 cap). States WHAT the skill does, WHEN to invoke, and WHEN to skip.
   ---

   # Your Skill Name

   ## When to use
   - Specific condition that mandates this skill
   - Another trigger condition

   ## Skip when
   - When NOT to use → alternative skill
   - Another exclusion
   ```

   **Schema fields:**

   - **Required:** `name` (must use `ring:` prefix), `description`
   - **Optional:** `argument-hint`, `allowed-tools`, `model`, `disable-model-invocation`, `user-invocable`, `paths`
   - Trigger / skip / sequence / related content lives in body H2 sections (`## When to use`, `## Skip when`, `## Sequence`, `## Related`). See [docs/FRONTMATTER_SCHEMA.md](docs/FRONTMATTER_SCHEMA.md) for the canonical schema.

3. **Update documentation**

   - Skills auto-load via `default/hooks/generate-skills-ref.py`
   - Test with session start hook

4. **Submit PR**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-skill-name
   git add default/skills/your-skill-name
   git commit -m "feat(skills): add your-skill-name for X"
   gh pr create
   ```

**For product/team-specific skills:**

1. **Create plugin structure**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p product-xyz/{skills,agents,hooks,lib}
   ```

2. **Register in marketplace**
   Edit `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "ring-product-xyz",
     "description": "Product XYZ specific skills",
     "version": "0.1.0",
     "source": "./product-xyz",
     "homepage": "https://github.com/lerianstudio/ring/tree/product-xyz"
   }
   ```

3. **Follow core plugin structure**
   - Use same layout as `default/`
   - Create `product-xyz/hooks/hooks.json` for initialization
   - Add skills to `product-xyz/skills/`

### Skill Quality Standards

- **Mandatory sections**: When to use, How to use, Anti-patterns
- **Include checklists**: TodoWrite-compatible task lists
- **Evidence-based**: Require verification before claims
- **Battle-tested**: Based on real-world experience
- **Clear triggers**: Unambiguous "when to use" conditions

## 📖 Documentation

- **Skills Quick Reference** - Auto-generated at session start from skill frontmatter
- [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) - Repository guide for Claude Code
- [MANUAL.md](MANUAL.md) - Quick reference for all skills, agents, and workflows
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) - Architecture diagrams and component relationships
- [Installer](installer/) - Multi-platform installation and migration

## 🎯 Philosophy

Ring embodies these principles:

1. **Skills are mandatory, not optional** - If a skill applies, it MUST be used
2. **Evidence over assumptions** - Prove it works, don't assume
3. **Process prevents problems** - Following workflows prevents known failures
4. **Small steps, verified often** - Incremental progress with continuous validation
5. **Learn from failure** - Anti-patterns document what doesn't work

## 📊 Success Metrics

Teams using Ring report:

- 90% reduction in "works on my machine" issues
- 75% fewer bugs reaching production
- 60% faster debugging cycles
- 100% of code covered by tests (enforced by TDD)

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Ring is built on decades of collective software engineering wisdom, incorporating patterns from:

- Extreme Programming (XP)
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Agile methodologies
- DevOps practices

Special thanks to the Lerian Team for battle-testing these skills in production.
